Included in this repository are two different sets of code that functionally perform the same.

The first is the jupyter notebook that mainly utilizes the Spark module to efficiently perform SQL queries. It is highly recommended to upload the notebook onto Google colab to efficiently run all the cells. Most local computers may take a significant amount of time to run a single query, let alone all of them.

The second is the databricks cloud notebook that also utilizes the Spark module on the cloud and is able to perform the queries more efficiently than the jupyter notebook. While its performance is highly lauded, I was only able to utilize the Community Edition of Databricks, along with a few tweaks to the jupyter notebook code, to perform these queries. The Community Edition also comes with the limitation of having a two week free trial before you are prompted to pay for it.
